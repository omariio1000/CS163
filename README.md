Welcome to C++ and Data Structures! We will be using the C++ Language to create applications, as well as learning theoretical and practical data structures for use in advanced programs.

 

There is no textbook for this class; video tutorials and online reference will be used throughout the class. We will be using the gcc compiler through the Cygwin unix emulator. Cygwin is a free download, so you can work on a PC at home. There are also other compilers that can be used on a Mac.

 

Sunset’s C++ and Data Structures class covers all the topics for Portland State University’s CS162 Introduction to Computer Science AND CS163 Data Structures, and students can earn college credit for the class.

 

Classroom policies

Food & Drink - Sorry! This is a computer classroom - no food or drink.

Electronic devices - Be responsible! Sometimes there is an appropriate time to use personal devices (phones, tablets, etc) but for the most part they should be put away. They should certainly be on silent!

Class equipment - Please be careful with class equipment including the computers and anything else. Missing or broken items are hard for us to replace!

Language - Like every class in the school, please use classroom-appropriate language and treat all students and staff with respect. This is the best way to make sure we all have fun!

 

 

Class details

How do grades works?

This class is a series of projects for you to complete individually (though some later projects may be done in teams). Each project has a set point value and projects must be done in order. Projects are ~50% of your grade, your practical midterm and practical final are ~25% combined, and your written midterm and written final are ~25% combined. At grade time, your accumulated points will determine your grade.

A : 90 - 100 %

B : 80 - 89 %

C : 70 - 79 %

D : 50 - 69 %

 

What about grading the projects?

Project descriptions all include exactly how points are awarded. Be sure to read the instructions carefully and ask if there are any parts you are unclear on. Don’t submit assignments until you’re ready!

 

What about multiple opportunities?

If you have at least three submitted drafts (of significance) in GitHub by the day of the deadline, then projects can be corrected and resubmitted as needed, up to 3 times per project. The new grade will replace the old.

 

What about homework?

There will not be homework assigned in addition to the projects, though you are free to work on projects outside of class. If you plan to do this, be sure to set up a way to store your projects online. I recommend GitHub or Google Drive, though there are other options available.

 

How do I submit assignments?

I will look at your code directly. Either you will submit it to your GitHub repository (which I have access to), or you will attach it into Google Classroom/Canvas.

 

What if I have other questions?

I also encourage you to trade contact information with your classmates, as they will be another excellent resource.
